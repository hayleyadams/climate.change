    <h2>and how celebrities are using their fame to influence the action</h2>
    
    <p class="about-paragraph"><img src="images/447cd6_ff04f51d7f6848258d18c70ccf635cb5_mv2_d_1888_2048_s_2.png" alt="earth" class="earth-pic">
        Climate change is a change in the usual weather found in a place. This could be a change in how much rain a location usually gets in a year. Or it could be a change in a location's usual temperature for a month or season. Climate change is also a change in Earth's climate. This could be a change in Earth's usual temperature. Or it could be a change in where rain and snow usually fall on Earth. Climate change occurs as a result of human production of ‘greenhouse gases’ into the Earth’s atmosphere. Gases that can be classed as greenhouse gases include water vapour (H2O), nitrous oxide (N2O), carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4). These gases trap heat emitted from Earth in its atmosphere, slowly warming the Earth and altering its climates. <br><br>
        Scientists think that Earth's temperature will keep going up for the next 100 years. This would cause more snow and ice to melt. Oceans would rise higher. Some places would get hotter whilst other places might have colder winters with more snow. Some places might get more rain. Other places might get less rain. Some places might have stronger hurricanes. Celebrities all around the world of different occupations are using their fame to spread their climate change opinions and theories. Most are trying to create and raise awareness to climate change solutions while others claim that it is a "made-up" concept and therefore, no action needs to be taken. However, there is clear scientific evidence that shows the gradual increase in average world temperatures, as well as the change in climates and the rise in sea levels. Climate change is now a concept which is readily discussed and educated to young people, who essentially, will have to cope with its effects on the Earth in future.
