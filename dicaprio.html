        Leonardo DiCaprio is an actor who starred in Titanic and The Revenant. At 24 years old he established the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation, a non-profit organisation, dedicated to raising environmental awareness. It focussed on Global Warming issues, preserving Earth’s biodiversity and supporting renewable energy sources. DiCaprio is a vegetarian and is even rumoured to be a vegan and consequently, supported the documentary Cowspiracy in 2014, about the impacts of agricultural farming on the environment. In 2007, Leonardo DiCaprio co-wrote, co-produced and narrated the documentary The 11th Hour about the relationship between people and global warming. As a result of the film and a fine art auction organized in 2013, DiCaprio raised almost $40 million towards his foundation. <br><br>
        In 2014, he was appointed as a United Nations Representative for climate change. Later that year DiCaprio spoke at the UN Climate Summit while also delivering a speech in 2016 before the signing of the Paris Climate Change Agreement. The 2016 film Before the Flood was a documentary that Leonardo DiCaprio produced and appeared in where various aspects of climate change were examined. At the Academy Awards Ceremony later that year, DiCaprio received the Best Actor Award. In his speech upon receiving the award, he stated, “Climate change is real, it is happening right now. It is the most urgent threat facing our entire species, and we need to work collectively together and stop procrastinating.” In April 2017, he participated in the Peoples Climate Change March, protesting President Donald Trump’s inaction on climate change.
