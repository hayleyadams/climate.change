        Michael Joseph Jackson was an American singer, songwriter, and dancer who died June 25, 2009. He was named the "King of Pop" and is regarded as one of the most significant cultural figures of the 20th century. Jackson died at age 50 of a cardiac arrest as a result of a drug overdose. However, before he died, he wrote, recorded and performed over 80 songs. Even many years ago when the idea of climate change and global warming had not been discovered, Jackson recognised the damage that humans were doing to our planet. <br><br>
        On November 27, 1995, Michael Jackson released the single ‘Earth Song’ which also featured in his album ‘HIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I’. Up until this point, he was known for producing music of social consciousness, however, this single was about the environment and animal welfare. The song featured lyrics such as “Did you ever stop to notice This crying Earth, these weeping shores” and “What have we done to the world, look what we've done”. Although the lyrics are not directly about climate change or global warming, they recognise the issue that humans are destroying the Earth. The music video that was released with the song years later, shows clips of a destroyed Earth. Jackson is pictured walking through a destroyed forest with fire surrounding him. The video also features native tribes witnessing the effects of animals being killed for human gain. Despite climate change not having been recognised at the time of the song release, Michael Jackson accurately identified how humans are destroying the Earth and its inhabitants.
