        Corey Baker was born in Christchurch, New Zealand and is currently a guest choreographer for the Royal New Zealand Ballet. He is an award-winning choreographer and filmmaker as a result of his innovative ideas. As a young dancer, Corey danced at the Ballet Theatre Basel of Switzerland and then went on to join BalletBoyz in the UK. However, he soon discovered his passion for creating dance works. His works are often featured in unusual locations such as the supermarket, playgrounds and shopping centres. <br><br>
        Corey Baker’s most recent work was titled “The First Dance”, a film set in Antarctica to explore the ideas of climate change. The film featured RNZB dancer Madeleine Graham and was the first major dance work to be filmed on Antarctica. The success of the film led to Baker creating “The Last Dance”, a stage-work performed by the RNZB. This piece was performed in the Dancing with Mozart tour in May 2018.
