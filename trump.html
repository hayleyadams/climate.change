        Donald Trump is the 45th President of the United States of America and is using his fame and power to reject climate change. He claims that climate change is a ‘hoax’ created by China to make US manufacturing non-competitive. In 2017 Trump announced his plan to pull the US out of the Paris Climate Agreement. He claimed that the agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions would negatively impact US factory production and worker demand. In September 2018, the Trump Administration also announced its plans to repeal rules that aim to restrict methane leaks on public and tribal lands. Under President Obama, these rules had been implemented to have a positive impact on global warming and climate change. <br><br>
        Donald Trump has been very vocal regarding his claims that climate change is fake. On many accounts, he has tweeted about his opinions on the subject. His most well-known tweet, posted on 6th November 2012 says, “The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.” This tweet has sparked international controversy and has had 96.8K retweets. Another tweet which riled those who are dedicated to eliminating climate change stated, “It’s really cold outside, they are calling it a major freeze, weeks ahead of normal. Man, we could use a big fat dose of global warming!”<br><br>
